# TypeScript Node Setup

This is a simple TypeScript Node setup that you can use as a starting point for your project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Gal-Lahat/simple-node-ts`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Run: `npm run start`

## Structure

- `src/` - TypeScript source files
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript files

## Configuration

- The project is module based
- The module type is `NodeNext`
- Targeting `ES2020`

Change the configuration in `tsconfig.json` to your needs.

## Why?

I created this repository because I was tired of setting up a new TypeScript Node project every time I wanted to start a new project. I hope this repository can help you as well.

For some reason i didn't find any minimalistic setup for node with typescript, so i made this one.
